#h;Bone Golem:
#is;“At first we scoffed as the bones rattled, then when the entire pile rose, we fled – the screams of the overconfident filling the air behind us.” – Kendrick Hiln thief of the Black Nine
A Bone Golem is the defiled abomination of animated skeletons crafted into a singular entity that desires nothing more than to add more material to its hideous form. Similar to other golems, Bone Golems serve the commands of their masters, following them with disturbing ferocity and precision. Sharing traits with its lesser skeletal counterparts, Bone Golems do not try to damage themselves to reach a goal, instead resorting to try a door handle rather than harm themselves by breaking through it.
Necromancers who have created these monstrosities also have the presence of mind to make the Bone Golem itself a master of bone. Capable of gathering bones together into a prison for its victims, Bone Golems serve adeptly as guards of ancient tombs or its master’s personal studies.
An empty shell driven by negative energy, the many heads of the Bone Golem still quietly whisper with the pain and suffering of those used to create the construct. Faint screams and cry echo from Bone Golems.

#h;Grave Titan:
A true success in the minds of necromancers across the world, Grave Titans are walking monoliths of the undead. Lumbering forward on its master’s command, the Grave Titan leaves a trail of death and lurching zombies. The Grave Titan views the world as a wheat field – reaping and sowing death as it walks.
#h;Abominable Creation:
Grave Titans form when powerful necromancers collect the bodies of numerous humanoids and a freshly slain giant. Amassing the corpses into a great mound atop the giant, the necromancers bind their energies to the mound, enriching it with a mass of negative energy. Rising from the mound, a Grave Titan begins to devour the corpses.
Once the final body is consumed, the Grave Titan completes its metamorphosis. The bodies that reside in the Titan reanimate, seeking to escape their prison. The torn hole in the Titan’s stomach quietly resonates with screams and cries as the restless zombies pull themselves free. Yet, any zombies that emerge from the Grave Titan are subject to the commands of the Titan’s master.
Following their reanimation, Grave Titan’s have little memory of their former lives. They understand the language of their master, but beyond that they do not think or act directly for themselves.
#h;Master’s Servant:
The necromancers who summon the Titan hold complete control over the being. Grave Titans follow their master or masters without question, moving with menacing grace. If left with no command, Grave Titans will wander towards the next living thing they see, desiring to bring death to the world.
Grave Titans are often employed as walking siege engines or guards to dark secrets. The Grave Titan’s ability to continually spawn zombies, make them highly desired to those not opposed to bolstering their army’s ranks.

“The smell would last for days, embedded in stone, water, cloth and skin, although if you waited long enough for the smell to be in your skin then you are as foolish as those who summoned the demon.” – From The Essence of Rot by Melcornus Bolel, Necromancer of Saldur
The living embodiment of disease and decay, a Herald of Rot looks like the abomination of humanoid, vulture and goat. Eyeless sockets stare at prey as a constant cloud of putrid offal hangs about the demon.
If summoned, a Herald of Rot will fixate on a given or freely chosen target. Once fixated, the Herald will speak to its prey telepathically, detailing how it will bring decay and desolation to everything around the victim.
Vanguard of demon armies, a Herald of Rot is a living chemical arsenal. Serving more powerful demon lords, they are often seen guarding important structures or enhancing torture by their mere presence. Heralds of Rot are most commonly found in the service of Demon Lord Juiblex, but their services expand far from the noxious lord’s control.

#h;Kraken Hatchling:
Every horror starts small. Even young the name of this beast strikes terror into the hearts of sailors and townsfolk: Kraken. Slumbering for years after its creation, the Kraken Hatchling grows in size and strength, waiting for the time to wake and bring destruction upon the world.
#h;Spawn of Legend:
Created from the malicious thoughts of their mature kin, the Kraken Hatchling spawns into a massive shell, where it lies dormant at the bottom of the sea or in fresh water lakes. Coastal civilizations and river ports fall into chaos once a Kraken Hatchling appears - its destructive wake ceasing trade or leaving towns and villages mere shell-carved craters.
Destined to grow into primeval forces of destruction, Kraken Hatchlings awake to drag themselves to or from the water, eating and destroying anything that stands in their way. Ominous portents mark the arrival of a #h;Kraken Hatchling. 
Terrible thunderstorms, floods and tremors wrack the land and rivers, and oceans grow thick with mucus before the Kraken Hatchling appears.
#h;Hibernating Destruction:
Slowly maturing into their horrific adult forms, Kraken Hatchlings hibernate in their great shells. Once every century, a Kraken Hatchling will awaken, to eat and travel closer to the ocean. The creation of new lakes and fresh riverbeds are common results as the Kraken Hatchling carves through the earth.
While dormant, Kraken Hatchlings will rarely react to the environment around it. Its malicious nature and presence, however, leaves a permanent mark the land. Large storms are common, nearby farmland fails due to mucus-saturated soil, and water close to the shell takes on an inky black hue.
#h;Mortal Foe:
Similar to their adult counterparts, the Kraken Hatchlings are often viewed as virtual gods. Coastal tribes, underwater communities or remote settlements deep in forests create cults and shrines for these beasts. If pleased, the Kraken Hatchling will becalm storms and remove its disease from the land. However, the mind the Kraken Hatchling quickly develops, planning the eventual demise of all things.

#h;Monks of the Five Spires
A swift jab sent a jolt of pain through Kine’s body. He grimaced, imagining every bar fight he had ever been in. The figure before him crouched low, balancing lightly on a single foot as the other poised, ready to lash out. Kine felt the sore spot where the monk had punched him - it burned slightly. He hefted his hammer and prepared to strike. The area where the monk had punched him suddenly flared with pain, feeling as though a hot brand had been placed there. Kine doubled over, hammer falling from his hand as he realized his mistake. This was not a brawling fighter; his opponent was a Monk of the Five Spires.
Trained to hone their magical Ki into dangerous burning attacks, the Monks of the Five Spires are well known for their martial brilliance. Capable of both taking and returning devastating blows, a Monk of the Five Spires practices asceticism and monastic values with fanatic fervor.
#h;Order of the Five.
Unlike others who take the path of a monk, Monks of the Five Spires are extremely selective about those who are permitted to join their way of life. Believing in strict discipline, physical prowess and the acceptance of the volatile emotions that drive them, Monks of the Five Spires push their initiates close todeath, looking to ignite in them the spark of Ki that will give them their abilities.
Located near volcanoes, the Five Spires are formidable towers of stone and obsidian. Rising high into the air, these towers serve as a proving ground for Five Spire Initiates and homes to the Masters of the Five Spires. Monks of the Five Spires view themselves as artisans of battle. In the face of other monastic paths, a Monk of the Five Spires understands that they may be inferior but when it comes to a fight, there is none better. Trained to accept radical emotions, Monks of the Five Spires often come off as explosive and extreme. These ranges of emotions are the key source of energy that drives the Monks of the Five Spires. They use these fiery emotions to enhance their Ki energies, manifesting them into searing pain.
#h;Initiation. 
With the desire to become a Monk of the Five Spires, initiates go to a small town known as Blackwrath. Nestled at the base of the Five Spires, initiates must climb up a tower to be accepted as an apprentice. Those who fall could not overcome the first challenge. Each day following, Initiates of the Five Spires must climb the tower. Here they train, work and follow their master’s missives. Each evening, initiates climb back down and sleep in Blackwrath. Only masters may live at the top of the Five Spires.
Initiates of the Five Spires often are sent on missions to expand their view of the world and uphold law. During this time, Initiates of the Five Spires are required to return half of their earnings to the Spires as well as new discoveries. Those who fail to do this are either rejected from the path or punished upon return.
Those who survive eventually attempt to join their masters. In a dangerous trial, the initiate swallows a draught of living fire, harvested from the nearby volcanoes. Wracked with pain, the initiate fights one of their masters. If they land a single hit upon the master, they are accepted as a Master of the Five Spires.

#h;Morphlit:
A Morphlit is small, weak and above all resilient. Creations of forgotten experiments, Morphlits adapt perfectly with their environment. They are wild, cunning creatures notorious for never failing to reach their victim. They embody a sense of brilliance long forgotten.
#h;Ever-changing packs:
Smarter than their small size indicates, Morphlits often join together to hunt larger prey. An instinctual understanding allows Morphlits to switch into the form most needed for their environment as well as vary their forms while in a pack to gain the most success during a hunt.
Large foreclaws or bat-like wings grow along Morphlits as they travel, granting them easy access to even the most difficult of terrain. Morphlits share a complex hivemind, which was given to them at their creation. Small hierarchies concerning shape and personality emerge from each form a Morphlit takes. Winged Morphlits take on an observer role in their society. Burrowing Morhplits are more aggressive, prone to competing against one another over a kill. Aquatic Morphits tend to be more passive unless provoked or agitated.
#h;Spawn of Ancients:
Long before the rise and fall of great empires, the upheaval of the earth and even before the pantheon of gods, Morphlits emerged as creations of great and mighty magic, formed to be durable test subjects to darker experiments. Seen as failures by their great masters, Morphlits were cast away, marked as inadequate.
Throughout the dynamic changes of the world, Morphlits thrived; the great magic that formed them acting as a shield against change. Still products of a deep desire, Morphlits continue to act in accordance to long imbued commands from their former creators.

If a creature bound by such a pact dies, the devil claims its soul, forcing it into servitude for eternity. The creature can't be brought back to life after its soul has been claimed.
Additionally, while bound by the infernal pact, the devil can communicate with the creature telepathically over any distance, even from another plane of existence. Once per month, the devil may charm the creature as if using the geas spell. The creature automatically fails the saving throw to resist the spell, and it can't be ended by any normal magic except for a wish spell, which also ends the pact.

Physically and mentally weak, these demons use their necrotic breath and flesh eating claws, caring little about their own explosive death.

#ip;“I never thought we would let one on the boat. Those black, doll-like eyes scare me as much as its ability to hunt.” – Jarod Kentworth, Second mate of Serena
With an the upper body of a shark and humanoid arms and legs, Selachians mark their bodies with scars, showing familial houses, honorable hunts or simply to make themselves more menacing. Selachian ruthlessness is well known among coastal and aquatic communities. Raiding parties wash like waves over sand castles, leaving destruction in their wake, before disappearing back into the sea.
#h;Selachian Settlements:
Most commonly found in the cold northern regions of the world, Selachian settlements are built in coral reefs, rocky coasts or underwater cliffs bordering a deep abyss. Unlike the rival merfolk, Selachians care little for the passage of time, often living for years without interaction with the outside world. Selachians tend to delve into the darkest parts of the ocean, hunting in packs to track down and kill larger prey. They come to the surface to raid ships and nearby settlements to collect more materials for their homes.
Selachians defend themselves with weapons taken from pirating or crafted from whatever materials were salvaged form shipwrecks, beaches, and dead undersea creatures.
#h;Hired-Muscle:
Often, pirating crews or desperate merchants will hire a pair of Selachians to work for them. Money does little to inspire a Selachian, but promise of fresh blood or an epic prize will keep a Selachian in check for a time. Bought more for their brawn than brain, Selachians find their place as bodyguards or thugs, their bulky forms not well suited for nimble work.
Pirates who convince these beasts to ship with them employ their strength as living grappling lines and frontline warriors. Sent to the board the enemy ship first, Selachians fall into bloody frenzies, leaving behind a wake of destruction until either alone or killed.
#h;The Biggest Prize:
Selachian communities believe in constantly outdoing one another. At birth, two Selachians are paired. For the rest of their lives, these Selachians wage a constant battle, heavily prompted by the community, to bring back the greatest prize. Often this prize is a kill or trophy but can also be feats of unlikely success. If a Selachian dies from this competition, their partner attempts to fulfill the pact for the other, marking it as the greatest prize they could achieve.
#h;Mortal Enemies:
Selachians and merfolk are mortal enemies. Years of raiding, destruction and war have carved a rift between the two species. Selachians also cannot abide merrow, who remind them too much of their less abyssal kin.
